This is a personal blog where we answer one or more questions each month from DataStax customers in a non-official, non-warranted, non much of anything forum.

>Customer:
>My company is investigating using DataStax for our new Customer/360 system in our customer call 
>center. I haven’t learned a new database in over 10 years, and should mention that I know none 
>of the NoSQL (post relational) databases. Can you help ?
>
>Daniel:
>Excellent question ! We’ve expertly used a good number of the leading NoSQL databases and while 
>DataStax may take longer to master than some, DataStax is easily more capable (functionally, and 
>scalability wise), than any other systems we have experienced.
>
>DataStax supports operational AND analytics workloads on one integrated platform, offers no single 
>point of failure, is proven to scale past 1000 nodes, and is enterprise ready with all of the requisite 
>security and administrative (maintenance and self healing) features.
>
>In this document we will:
>
>• Walk through a reasonably complete primer on DataStax Enterprise (DSE) terms, its object hierarchy, history, use, operating conventions, configuration files, and more.
>
>• Build a 2 node DSE cluster from scratch with a NetworkTopologyStragey. 
>
>• Demonstrate network partition failure tolerance.
>
>• Demonstrate strong and eventual consistency.
